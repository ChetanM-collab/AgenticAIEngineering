# AgenticAIEngineering

A collection of small, focused projects exploring modern **Agentic AI** concepts/frame-works.  
Each folder contains an independent project demonstrating different areas of **agent-based LLM systems**, routing, MCP tooling, and autonomous AI patterns.

This repository serves as a practical portfolio of my learning journey in building real, production-ready Agentic AI systems.
