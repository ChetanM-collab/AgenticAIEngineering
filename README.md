# AgenticAIEngineering

A collection of small, focused projects exploring modern Agentic AI concepts.  
Each folder contains an independent project demonstrating different areas of agent-based LLM systems.

This repository serves as a practical portfolio of my learning journey in building real Agentic AI systems.
