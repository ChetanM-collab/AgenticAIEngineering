# AgenticAIEngineering

A collection of small, focused projects exploring modern Agentic AI concepts.  
Each folder contains an independent project demonstrating different areas of agent-based LLM systems such as MCP tools, LLM routing, API integrations, autonomous workflows, and interactive UIs.

This repository serves as a practical portfolio of my learning journey in building real Agentic AI systems.

A huge thank you to **Ed Donner** and his Udemy course **Agentic AI Engineering**.  
These projects were created while practising concepts learned from the course.  
Ed’s clear explanations and real-world examples made a big difference in understanding how to design and implement intelligent agents.
